# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Background
I've been rewarded with a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with the trip planning, we have decided to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps taken to accomplish this task.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, we use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

## Part 2: Design A Climate App
Design a Flask API based on the queries that we just developed.
